# daily sound machine
A rhythm generator that changes every day built from sounds recorded in a single day. 
This is a refined and updated version of my Impractical Device instrument called "A Day That Will Never Happen Again".
For more details about that instrument: http://www.impracticaldevices.com/volume-1/

You'll need a folder called "sounds" filled with sounds that you want to use. The patch will automatically choose 15 WAV or AIFF files that are in that folder.

Assuming the Zexy external is properly installed, a different subset of 15 sounds will be selected each day that the patch is opened.

I would suggest using relatively short sound recordings (a few seconds?) but also feel free to ignore that advice because maybe it would be fun.

This uses:
- Pure Data
- Zexy externals for Pure Data
